## Canvas & Layout

```js
const TILE_SIZE = 48;
const GRID_OFFSET_X = 16;
const GRID_OFFSET_Y = 40;
```

Canvas internal resolution: **960×640**. The container is `position: fixed; inset: 0` — canvas stretches to fill the full browser window. Click coordinates are scale-compensated using `canvas.getBoundingClientRect()`.

---

## Game Phases

```js
const GamePhase = {
    TITLE, CUTSCENE, PLAYER_TURN, UNIT_SELECTED, UNIT_MOVED,
    ATTACK_SELECT, ENEMY_TURN, ANIMATION, VICTORY, DEFEAT,
    ENDING, TETRIS, AD_BREAK
};
```

---

## Game State

```js
let game = {
    phase: GamePhase.TITLE,
    currentLevel: 0,
    turn: 1,
    units: [],
    grid: [],           // game.grid[y][x] = Terrain object

    pendingMoveTile: null,    // {tx, ty} tile clicked awaiting confirmation
    betrayalTriggered: false,
    horsesCollected: 0
};
```

## Terrain Types

`game.grid[y][x]` holds a Terrain reference. Tiles with `defBonus > 0` show a `+N` badge.

| Key | Name | moveCost | defBonus | Notes |
|-----|------|----------|----------|-------|
| PLAIN | Plain | 1 | 0 | Default outdoor tile |
| FOREST | Forest | 2 | 2 | Also heals +1 HP/turn |
| MOUNTAIN | Mountain | 3 | 3 | High ground |
| WALL | Wall | 99 | 0 | Impassable |
| WATER | Water | 99 | 0 | Impassable |
| PORTAL | Portal | 1 | 0 | Pulsing purple arc animation |
| TEMPLE | Temple | 1 | 2 | Stone floor |
| CLOUD | Cloud | 1 | 1 | Sky edge tiles |
| LAVA | Lava | 99 | 0 | Impassable; placed units take −2 HP/turn |
| THRONE | Throne | 1 | 4 | Heals +2 HP/turn; triggers Level 4 secret |
| OFFICE_FLOOR | Office Floor | 1 | 0 | Corporate lobby |
| GYM_FLOOR | Gym Floor | 1 | 0 | Mall / gym interior |
| EQUIPMENT | Equipment | 2 | 1 | Desks, gym machines |
| EXIT | Exit | 1 | 0 | Pulsing red rect; Level 11 escape point |
| STAIR | Stairs | 2 | 0 | Two-floor connector; draws 4 horizontal step lines |
| UPPER_FLOOR | Upper Floor | 1 | 1 | Elevated zone; height advantage |

Terrain HP effects per turn (applied in `endEnemyTurn`): LAVA −2, FOREST +1, THRONE +2.

## Unit Templates

`createUnit(type, gx, gy, team)` clones the template and adds: `type, maxHp, gx, gy, team, acted, alive, isLarryDunk, invisible, badDriving, attacksLeft`. `attacksLeft = 2` for `cainAbel`, 1 for all others.

## Core Mechanics

### Movement

`getMovementTiles(unit)` — BFS up to `unit.mov` movement points. Tiles with `moveCost ≥ 99` block movement. Enemy-occupied tiles block; ally-occupied tiles are passable but not selectable as destinations.

### Attack

`getAttackTiles(unit, fromX, fromY)` — returns tiles within Manhattan distance `unit.range` containing a living non-neutral enemy.

**paraplegicLarry exception:** If any enemy is within Manhattan ≤ 1 of (fromX, fromY), returns `[]` immediately. Shows `TOO CLOSE!` banner.

### Combat Formula

```
damage = max(1, attacker.atk - defender.def - terrain.defBonus)
defender.hp -= damage
```

**Counterattack:** If defender survives and attacker is within `defender.range`:
```
cDmg = max(1, defender.atk - attacker.def - attackerTerrain.defBonus)
attacker.hp = max(1, attacker.hp - cDmg)   // counterattacks CANNOT kill
```
If the clamp fires, shows `SURVIVED!` banner.

**Larry Dunk death:** If `defender.isLarryDunk && defender.team === 'enemy'` and HP hits 0: set `defender.hp = 1`, mark `attacker.acted = true`, call `startTetrisCapture(defender)` synchronously. **Initialize the Tetris board before setting `phase = TETRIS`** or the render loop crashes.

### Turns

1. **Player Phase** — units act one at a time. Turn ends when all player units have `acted = true`, or player clicks End Turn.
2. `checkTurnEvents()` fires at turn end.
3. **Enemy Phase** — AI acts for all enemies sequentially.
4. `endEnemyTurn()` resets `sprayTanned` flags and all `acted` flags, increments `game.turn`, returns to Player Phase.

### Victory / Defeat

- **Defeat:** Haras dies, or all player units die.
- **Victory:** Level's `victoryCheck()` returns true (default: all enemies dead).
- `checkVictoryDefeat()` exits immediately if `phase === TETRIS`.

---

## Special Abilities

**Spray Tan** (`larryDunk`, `britishLarry`): when defender survives, defender + all enemies adjacent to defender lose 1 range (`sprayTanned = true`). Resets at `endEnemyTurn`. Shows `SPRAY TAN!` banner.

**Cannibalism** (`financierLarry`): after dealing damage, attacker heals `min(damage, maxHp - hp)` HP. Shows `CANNIBALISM!` banner and green `+N` floating number.

**2 Attacks/Turn** (`cainAbel`): `attacksLeft: 2`. After first attack, decrement; if > 0 allow another attack before marking acted.

**Chain Kill** (`axeLarry`): after killing a non-Larry unit, `setTimeout(500)` then one free attack on nearest adjacent enemy. `isChain = true` prevents recursion. Shows `CHAIN KILL!` banner.

**Invisible** (`cerealLarry`): `invisible: true`. Enemy AI skips invisible units in all target selection.

**Ad Break** (`investmentLarry`, player only): on attack, store `pendingAdBreak`, set `phase = AD_BREAK`, show full-screen fake YouTube ad (LARRY DUNK FINANCIAL SERVICES™) with 3-second countdown. "Skip Ad ▶" calls `skipAdBreak()` which calls `_resolveCombat()`.

**Bad Driving** (`femaleLarry`): `badDriving: true`. In `moveUnit()`, 20% chance to land on a random adjacent tile instead. Shows `Bad Driving!` banner.

**Eye Bullets** (`paraplegicLarry`): range 3, cannot attack if any enemy is adjacent. Implemented as early return in `getAttackTiles()`. Shows `TOO CLOSE!` banner.

---

## Tetris Capture

Triggered synchronously in `_resolveCombat()` when a Larry Dunk (enemy team) hits 0 HP.

| Unit | Threshold | On Fail |
|------|-----------|---------|
| Most Larry Dunks | 200 | Soft retry |
| cainAbel | 100 | Soft retry (story guaranteed) |
| mrRuno | 800 | Escapes permanently — `onSuccess` returns early |
| zeusLarry | ∞ (rigged) | Rival steals him → chaos cutscene → `loadLevel(13)` |

Board: 10×20. Standard pieces (I,O,T,S,Z,J,L). Arrow keys / WASD to move/rotate, Space to hard drop.
Speed: 800ms drop → 150ms minimum, −50ms per 50 pts.
On success: unit joins `team = 'player'`, type added to `game.capturedLarryDunks`.

---

## Larry Dunk Selector

Before levels with `ldSlots`, player picks Larry Dunks from their captured pool to bring into battle. Selections stored in `game.selectedLarryDunks`, spawned at designated spawn tiles via `spawnSelectedLarryDunks()`.

When jumping to a level via level select, `game.capturedLarryDunks` is pre-filled with the LDs that would have been captured by that point (`LD_POOL_AT_LEVEL` in main.js).

---

## AI

`doEnemyAction(enemy)`:

1. Filter living player units, exclude invisible ones.
2. Score each visible player unit: `score = (maxHp - hp) + (type === 'haras' ? 20 : 0) - getManhattan(enemy, unit) * 2`.
3. If attack tiles exist pre-move, attack highest-scoring target in range.
4. Otherwise: move toward highest-scoring target, then attack post-move.

Enemies have a **bias** toward Haras (+20) and wounded units (up to ~35 pts), tempered by distance so nearby units stay relevant.

`endEnemyTurn()`: resets `sprayTanned`, resets `acted`, increments `game.turn`, applies terrain HP effects, returns to Player Phase.

**Level 11 special:** `mrRuno` moves toward EXIT tiles each turn and never attacks.

---

## Rendering

`render()` called every frame:

1. Grid tiles (terrain color + grid lines)
2. Terrain effects: PORTAL pulsing arc, EXIT pulsing rect, STAIR step lines
3. DEF bonus badges on tiles with `defBonus > 0`
4. Hover preview: movement + attack reach for hovered unit
5. Phase hint above grid: "Select a unit" / "Click blue tile to move" / "Click red tile to attack — or End Turn"
6. Move tiles: blue overlay (alpha 0.45) + white inner stroke
7. Attack tiles: pulsing red overlay (`sin(Date.now()/200)`) + pink inner stroke
8. Cursor, units, selected unit pulse ring
9. Animations (hit flash, damage numbers, death burst, screen flash)
10. Cutscene dim overlay; Tetris overlay (delegated to tetris.js)

**End Turn button:** gold-green with pulsing `box-shadow`. Auto-disabled during Enemy Phase.

## SFX

`playSound(name)` — 13 synthesized sounds via Web Audio API, no external files:
`select`, `move`, `hit`, `death`, `tetris_place`, `tetris_clear`, `tetris_success`, `tetris_fail`, `player_phase`, `enemy_phase`, `ad_jingle`, `victory`, `defeat`

---

## Dialogue System

`startCutscene(lines, callback)` — typewriter effect, Space/Enter/click to advance. Each line: `{ speaker: 'NAME', text: '...', color: '#hex' }`. Skip All button calls `endCutscene()` immediately. Back button replays previous line.

All dialogue text lives in `DIALOGUE.md` and is synced to `levels.js` on request ("apply dialogue").

---

## Implementation Notes

- **Tetris init order:** Always set up `tetris.board` **before** setting `game.phase = TETRIS`. If phase is set first, the render loop tries to read the board before it exists and crashes `requestAnimationFrame`.
- **Phase guards:** Every system that changes phase checks current phase first. `checkVictoryDefeat()` returns if `TETRIS`. `finishUnitAction()` checks before setting `PLAYER_TURN`.
- **onVictory called once:** Only from the victory screen click handler in `main.js`, not from `checkVictoryDefeat()`.
- **Attack-select:** Clicking a friendly unit tile in `ATTACK_SELECT` phase is ignored — does not cancel the attack.
- **Counterattack:** Cannot kill the attacker — floored at 1 HP. Shows `SURVIVED!` banner if clamped.
